This is a fork of CG360's [original mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/survival-building-toolkit-fabric): a fabric port of Quark's Reach-Around Placement feature with some tweaks to refine its experience. It's similar to Minecraft:
Bedrock Edition's bridging features. Blocks can be placed horizontally for adjacent block gaps or vertically underneath
blocks where the interactable surface is not visible.

This fork brings back the old text-based HUD and merges it with the crosshair which is a lot less intrusive than the current icon-based system.

# Changes from Quark include:

- Larger target areas for block placement
