# Survival Building Toolkit (Fabric) ðŸ› 

I plan for this Minecraft mod to include a collection of utilities that can be used when building in Survival Mode without the need 
for a server-side mod.

### âš  Multiplayer Warning: 
Do not use this mod on servers which don't outright approve of its use. It can provide an unfair competitive advantage
and may trigger anticheats. You have been warned! ^^


### Current Features:

 - Reacharound Placement:
   - Ported from [Quark (Forge)](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Quark) with some modifications
     - [ðŸ”— License](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Quark/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
   - Allows for Bedrock-Style bridging where you can place blocks in the air in front of or below the block you're 
     currently standing on.
